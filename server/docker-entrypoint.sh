#   1. Ensure the master admin seed exists (deterministic via RELAY_MASTER_SEED,
#      otherwise generated on first run). The DB itself is migrated by the
#      server's FastAPI lifespan on startup.
#   2. exec the server process (replacing the shell so signals reach it).

# other failure (DB unreachable, etc.) aborts the container (fail-fast) so the
# orchestrator can restart it.
